## Abstract <a name = "abstract"></a>
A management information system (MIS) is an information system used for decision-making, and for the coordination, control, analysis, and visualization of information in an organization.
The study of the management information systems involves people, processes and technology in an organizational context.
The ultimate goal of the use of a management information system is to increase the value of the organisation. This is done by providing timely and appropriate information allowing them to make effective decisions within a shorter period of time.

## Description <a name = "description"></a>

The main objective of the project is to take the conventional MIS system  to a much more modular and interactive level by adding attractive dashboard designs, Infographics for the reports and analysis, charts and graphs for displaying information and many more. This would increase the user interactivity and usability and help the user to push and fetch data easily.
Our focus is on an Educational MIS [3] and main users would be teachers and students. There will be separate logins for different types of users and the respective data would be displayed.

## Modules <a name = "modules"></a>

1. **Dashboard**

The dashboard would be the screen to visualize the whole system. The student, teacher and admin logins would be different. The users can see the reports, graphs, charts, and other information regarding their data.

2. **Attendance/Marks Analysis and Visualisation**

The attendance and marks can be added by teachers and seen by the students. There would be analysis done on the attendance and marks and also suggest the student for ways to improve their score. The teachers and students can also visualize the attendance and marks trends in various hours, exams, subjects and classes.

3. **Login Validation**

There would be different types of users who use the system from administrators, teachers to students. So the login validations would be done. Registration and login systems would be included.

4. **Infographics**

The data visualisation is a key feature added in our system. The conventional way of displaying all data in tables and text is being upgraded to modern graphs, charts and other infographic display components .

5. **Database and Data Storage**

The data of users, their information and other data generated in the website needs to be stored securely. And hence, we need to apply database concepts and data storage techniques to store this information.
